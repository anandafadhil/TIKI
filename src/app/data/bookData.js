However, many schools in Indonesia face significant challenges in building and maintaining libraries. Limited budgets often mean students have access to only a small number of books, many of which are outdated or in poor condition. Tikii’s 'School Support Program' addresses this gap by offering preloved books to schools at no cost or heavily discounted rates. These donations include a mix of fiction, nonfiction, and reference materials to enrich learning experiences. By equipping classrooms with vibrant, diverse libraries, Tikii is helping students discover the magic of stories and the importance of knowledge. In one case, a rural school in Sumatra transformed its empty library into a thriving hub of activity after receiving books from Tikii. The school’s headmaster praised the program, saying, 'These books are opening up new worlds for our students, inspiring them to dream beyond their surroundings.'",
